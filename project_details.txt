Important Concepts  
1. Composite Key Constraint – The syntax given in the class notes to create composite key will not
work on Access 2007. The correct syntax to create a composite key is using CONSTRAINT clause.
For ex –  
a. CREATE TABLE Test(ID Integer, FName CHAR(20), LName CHAR(20), CONSTRAINT Cpk
PRIMARY KEY(ID, LName));  
2. UPDATE Statement - You can use UPDATE statement to update the values (or data) of a table.
This is quite useful when you want to update multiple column values from many tables, based
on some condition. The syntax is as follows –  
a. UPDATE TableName
SET ColName=ColName*0.1, Col2Name=Col2Name+5
WHERE Col4Name=’January’


1. Create a table “Station”  to store information about weather observation stations:
ID Number Primary Key
CITY CHAR(20),
STATE CHAR(2),
LAT_N Number
LONG_W Number
2. Insert the following records into the table:
ID CITY STATE LAT_N LONG_W
13 Phoenix AZ 33 112
44 Denver CO 40 105
66 Caribou ME 47 68
3. Execute a  query to look at table STATION in undefined order.
4. Execute a query to select Northern stations (Northern latitude > 39.7).
5. Create another table, ‘STATS’, to store normalized temperature and precipitation data:
Column Data type Remark
ID Number must match some STATION table ID(so name & location
will be known).
MONTH Number Range between 1 and 12
TEMP_F Number in Fahrenheit degrees,Range between -80 and 150,
RAIN_I Number in inches, Range between 0 and 100,
There will be no Duplicate ID and MONTH combination.
6. Populate the table STATS with some statistics for January and July: 
ID MONTH TEMP_F RAIN_I
13 1 57.4 .31
13 7 91.7 5.15
44 1 27.3 .18
44 7 74.8 2.11
66 1 6.7 2.1
66 7 65.8 4.52
7. Execute a query to display temperature stats (from STATS table) for each city (from Station
table).  
8. Execute a query to look at the table STATS, ordered by month and greatest rainfall, with
columns rearranged. It should also show the corresponding cities.  
9. Execute a query to look at temperatures for July from table STATS, lowest temperatures first,
picking up city name and latitude.
10. Execute a query to show MAX and MIN temperatures as well as average rainfall for each city.
11. Execute a query to display each city’s monthly temperature in Celcius and rainfall in
Centimeter.  
12. Update all rows of table STATS to compensate for faulty rain gauges known to read 0.01
inches low.
13. Update Denver's July temperature reading as 74.9
